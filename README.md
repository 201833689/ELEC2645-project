# ELEC2645 Project

This is my scientific calculator program!

It has 4 modes of operation
- Arithmetic (+,-,*,/,^,R)
- Trig functions (basic,hyperbolic,inverse)
- Logarithms (log10,ln,logn)
- Quadrartics (solves linear and quadratic equations)

My calculator ensures all user inputs are valid and can then perform various calculations depending on the users choices and inputs.

To compile the program use gcc main.c funcs.c -lm -o main.out and then run ./main.out
